# KU Polls

A web application for conducting polls at [Kasetsart University](https://www.ku.ac.th).


## Background

KU staff and students often want to conduct polls or surveys within KU, or within a unit or organization at KU. The polls or surveys provide input for making decisions, planning events, and learning others’ preferences and ideas, but they aren’t critical (like voting for a representative).

The most common poll/survey questions are multiple choice, where the poll taker selects a choice from a list of choices.
